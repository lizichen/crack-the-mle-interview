A typical Zillow Offers transaction flow: 

> Purchase a home -> Renovate the home -> List the home with a new list price -> Cut prices, pay maintainese cost regularly -> Sell the home

We ran an experiment back in January.  

- Group A: 100 random homes were initially listed at a price $10,000 higher than the regular list price recommended by the sale agents. 
- Group B: 100 homes listed at usual price as recommended by the sale agents. 

How would you go about assessing which method is better? Assume all the homes have sold, we can get all the data you need. 



Constraint: can only hold 500 homes at a time

Suppose we have censorship. 
- Group A: 25 sold, average profit of those that sold is $4806.
- Group B: 58 sold, average profit of those that sold is $3691.  

Given that $4806 > $3691, so I conclude Group A is better. Is this a fair conclusion?
