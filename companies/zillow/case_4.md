We are trying to decide which homes to buy. Buying homes carries risks:

Profit = sale price - purchase price - rehab cost + fee - holding_cost(T)

- time to sell
   - y: days on market for sold properties
   - d: holding costs, capital constraints
- price uncertainty
   - y: price of sold properties
   - d: purchase price, sale price, adverse selection
- age house
   - x: year built
   - d: rehab
- other factors

a) we want to buy 50% of all houses. 
reward = <Profit>
risk   = sqrt(<dProfit ^2>)
risk vs reward: "Maximize" expected ensemble reward without taking on "too much" risk
p( P_total | {h} ), 
E[P_total] -> percentile_.25

What is the best list price for a given home?
