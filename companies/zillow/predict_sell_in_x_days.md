We have a dataset of all home sales across the US for the past 10 years, along with a set of features for each home including:
- Initial list date
- Zip Code
- Initial List Price
- Square Footage
- Sale Date
- Sale Price
- Bedroom Count
- Bathroom Count
- Home Type

How would you create a model that predicted whether a home would sell within 90 days of its initial list date?
